## About

This Maven project is simple plugin for Nuxeo Platform.

This plugin does not do much, don't use it if you expect features.

This module was created as a simple coding exercise.

## Game's rules

During this exercise you will need to :

 - understand what the code is supposed to do
 - fix it so that it works
 - answer some questions

The exercise is composed of several steps.
When you complete a step you will be given a message that contains :

 - A hint about how to achieve the next step
 - A ticket number

You should commit on your local repository using the ticket number as comment.

For some steps, there are probably several ways to reach the goal, just choose the method you consider to be the most efficient.


## Dev environment

The target test workstation should already be configured with all the softwares you may need to complete the exercise :

 * JDK 6
 * Maven 2
 * Git
 * Eclipse IDE (/opt/eclipse)
 * a running Nuxeo Platform instance (/opt/nuxeo-cap/)
 * Browser and Internet access

## Building

Since this is a Maven project, to run the build without the tests, simply run :

    mvn -o -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install

## Anything more ?

This module contains nothing really complicated.
This is not rocket science : just some simple issues that provide an opportunity to discuss about coding and see how we can find the solution.

Even if this module is a WebEngine plugin for Nuxeo Platform, you don't really need to know how Nuxeo platform work.
If you progress step by step in the right order, you will be given the required informations.

2 Eyes, 1 brain, 1 keyboard and some knowledge about java and web technologies should be enough to go through all the steps of this little exercise.

## Getting started

The very first step is about making this web application saying welcome to you.

Find out what the welcome message is and you will get a hint for the next step.
